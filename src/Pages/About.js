    <div className='about'><p>My name is Stamatia Bampa and I am a <b> Junior Web Developer </b>just starting up and a <b>Graphic Designer</b>. I recently relocated from Athens
    to Brussels, seeking to get insights into another cultural environment and improve myself professionally and
    educationally.
    I am conscious of the creativity around me, sometimes drawing inspiration from even the simplest daily activities. My biggest stimulation comes from art, cartoon movies and fashion which I incorporate in my work.
    This portofilio is a collection of my personal concept projects created with my love and passion for all aspects
    of graphic design.</p></div></Container>
